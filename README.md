# Deep-Learning
This Repository contains list of projects that I have worked to complete "deep-learning" nanodegree

# Projects
- Your First Neural Network: Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
- *Image classification:* Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- *Text Generation:* Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
- *Machine Translation:* Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
- *Face Generation:* Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
